MateCo Customer Support chat
====

This app lets you connect and chat with the Customer Support "team" of MateCo (a terribly named fictitious company).
On the "other" side, the support can answer your messages using a simple web page.

Note: This app only serves the purposes of development playground, learning and showcasing for myself.

General architecture
----
The app is native Android programmed with Java, while the Customer Support client is an SPA using Vue.js.
For messaging and presence, it uses PubNub - a powerful tool that allows for complex communication between devices.
No server-side code is used currently, as communication not persisted anywhere and only text messages are exchanged.

The client app
----
On startup, the app will create (or re-use) a uuid, whichis used to identify this 'pubnub client' uniquely (and hence messages can be exchanged 'privately').
Then, client will subscribe to its 'pubnub channel' for customer support (string using pattern 'chat_<client-uuid>'.
This connection allows this client to receive/send messages to/from the Customer Support page.
The Chat Activity is then started, bringing in the views that allow for user interaction.


The customer support page
----
Since this was not the focus of this iteration, this page is very simple and all the code is built into a single HTML file. This is done so its easier for it to be used - just open this file in a browser.
This file will first load its dependencies (Vue.js client, PubNub JS client, Bootstrap JS/CSS).
After all dependencies are loaded, the Vue.js app loads. It then lists all live 'pubnub channels' that match 'chat_*', making a simple list with links to it.
When a link is tapped, it opens up a simple view with chat messages box, and a text input box. Its possible to send/receive messages with that specific client in this interface.
